Chris Wallace 	Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=80.33#	1:20	80	50	148.8	124
Chris Wallace 	This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight’s debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=130.12#	2:10	130	39	156.923076923077	102
Vice President Joe Biden 	How you doing, man?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=169.4#	2:49	169	2	120	4
President Donald J. Trump 	How are you doing?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=171.37#	2:51	171	0		4
Vice President Joe Biden 	I’m well.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=171.91#	2:51	171	20		2
Chris Wallace 	Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let’s get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate’s to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=191.81#	3:11	191	50	159.6	133
President Donald J. Trump 	Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=241.89#	4:01	241	52	180	156
President Donald J. Trump 	And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they’d try and do it faster. There’s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=293.47#	4:53	293	29	202.758620689655	98
Chris Wallace 	President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=322.97#	5:22	322	7	128.571428571429	15
Vice President Joe Biden 	Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=329.01#	5:29	329	5	192	16
President Donald J. Trump 	Thank you, Joe.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=334.41#	5:34	334	2	90	3
Vice President Joe Biden 	The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=336.6#	5:36	336	36	195	117
Vice President Joe Biden 	Now, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens? Women’s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=372.13#	6:12	372	56	168.214285714286	157
Vice President Joe Biden 	And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=428.98#	7:08	428	26	166.153846153846	72
President Donald J. Trump 	There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=454.48#	7:34	454	27	180	81
Vice President Joe Biden 	He’s elected to the next election.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=481.48#	8:01	481	1		6
President Donald J. Trump 	During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=482.36#	8:02	482	22	180	66
Vice President Joe Biden 	That’s simply not true.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=504.31#	8:24	504	1	240	4
President Donald J. Trump 	Well, you’re certainly going to socialist. You’re going to socialist-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=505.23#	8:25	505	4	150	10
Chris Wallace 	Gentlemen, we’re now into open discussion.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=509.42#	8:29	509	2	180	6
Vice President Joe Biden 	Open discussion.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=511.05#	8:31	511	1	120	2
Chris Wallace 	Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=512.29#	8:32	512	1		9
Vice President Joe Biden 	Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=513.93#	8:33	513	25	160.8	67
President Donald J. Trump 	That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=538.73#	8:58	538	2		13
Vice President Joe Biden 	That is simply a lie.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=540.94#	9:00	540	2	150	5
President Donald J. Trump 	Your party doesn’t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=542.01#	9:02	542	3		15
Vice President Joe Biden 	The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=545.16#	9:05	545	3	220	11
President Donald J. Trump 	And they’re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=548.21#	9:08	548	1		10
Vice President Joe Biden 	I am the Democratic Party right now.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=549.74#	9:09	549	2	210	7
President Donald J. Trump 	Not according to Harris.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=551.87#	9:11	551	1	240	4
Vice President Joe Biden 	The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=552.26#	9:12	552	27	166.666666666667	75
President Donald J. Trump 	Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=579.6#	9:39	579	8	172.5	23
Vice President Joe Biden 	I’m happy to talk about this.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=587.49#	9:47	587	1		6
President Donald J. Trump 	And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=588.13#	9:48	588	10	246	41

Vice President Joe Biden 	Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade.

Chris Wallace 	Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=671.86#	11:11	671	14	137.142857142857	32

President Donald J. Trump 	Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=688.55#	11:28	688	3		16

President Donald J. Trump 	Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=698.66#	11:38	698	6	140	14

Chris Wallace 	Mr. President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=706.84#	11:46	706	6	240	24
President Donald J. Trump 	Go ahead.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=712.01#	11:52	712	1	120	2
Chris Wallace 	You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=713.05#	11:53	713	23	138.260869565217	53
President Donald J. Trump 	Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=736.12#	12:16	736	24	205	82
Chris Wallace 	What about pre-existing conditions?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=760.09#	12:40	760	0		4
President Donald J. Trump 	All of the things that we’ve done.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=760.29#	12:40	760	1		7
Vice President Joe Biden 	He has not done healthcare.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=761.99#	12:41	761	1		5
President Donald J. Trump 	I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=762.82#	12:42	762	21	208.571428571429	73
Chris Wallace 	Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=783.52#	13:03	783	1		8
President Donald J. Trump 	This is big stuff.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=784.22#	13:04	784	2	120	4
Chris Wallace 	Sir, you’ll be happy. I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=786.72#	13:06	786	11	190.909090909091	35
Vice President Joe Biden 	Yes.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=797.26#	13:17	797	0		1
Chris Wallace 	And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=797.57#	13:17	797	6	190	19
Vice President Joe Biden 	It is not.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=803.55#	13:23	803	2	90	3
Chris Wallace 	If I start asking the question.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=805.27#	13:25	805	1		6
President Donald J. Trump 	That’s not what your party says, by the way.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=806.51#	13:26	806	3	180	9
Chris Wallace 	And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=809.01#	13:29	809	3		13
Vice President Joe Biden 	It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=812.81#	13:32	812	25	158.4	66

President Donald J. Trump 	Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=959.07#	15:59	959	43	220.46511627907	158

Chris Wallace 	Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn’t brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress.

We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir.

Vice President Joe Biden 	Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That’s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn’t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people. You don’t panic. He panicked.

Vice President Joe Biden 	He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing.

Vice President Joe Biden 	I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1257.49#	20:57	1257	33	203.636363636364	112

President Donald J. Trump 	If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country.

President Donald J. Trump 	You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1327.29#	22:07	1327	47	183.829787234043	144
President Donald J. Trump 	The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood.

Vice President Joe Biden 	And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/C-8bDp99BJeCjsjMD_TLZx3mzKMYLQlRNcIpn01gIDIitp25MT_XakH7HIktIkzYjsjgbemzC1JlO5zsFuPOVzteEGE?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1413.74#	23:33	1413	24	225	90

Vice President Joe Biden 	His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don’t.

Chris Wallace 	I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can’t trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.” Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=111.88#	1:51	1576	27	180	81

He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=175.87#	2:55	1640	32	185.625	99

President Donald J. Trump 	Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=208.75#	3:28	1673	16	198.75	53

President Donald J. Trump 	Because you know what?

Vice President Joe Biden 	Well, let’s have this debate-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=229.08#	3:49	1694	2	150	5
President Donald J. Trump 	Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=231.35#	3:51	1696	11	256.363636363636	47

President Donald J. Trump 	Okay. It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=244.12#	4:04	1709	2		12
Chris Wallace 	Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=246#	4:06	1711	25	180	75
Vice President Joe Biden 	Because he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need.

Vice President Joe Biden 	Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=292.81#	4:52	1757	12	185	37

President Donald J.

President Donald J. Trump 	Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=315.88#	5:15	1780	39	201.538461538461	131

Chris Wallace 	President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer.

President Donald J. Trump 	No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=380.23#	6:20	1845	13		58

President Donald J. Trump 	I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.

Vice President Joe Biden 	Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters.

Chris Wallace 	… in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=562.98#	9:22	2027	30	162	81
President Donald J. Trump 	So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=592.05#	9:52	2057	39	207.692307692308	135
President Donald J. Trump 	A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=631.85#	10:31	2096	33	214.545454545454	118
President Donald J. Trump 	When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.”	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=664.58#	11:04	2129	32	206.25	110

Vice President Joe Biden 	Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=743.42#	12:23	2208	17	204.705882352941	58
Vice President Joe Biden 	Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=760.63#	12:40	2225	45	200	150
Vice President Joe Biden 	Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=805.21#	13:25	2270	29	182.068965517241	88

All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market.

Chris Wallace 	We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions.

Vice President Joe Biden 	It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that.

Vice President Joe Biden 	… second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1633.7#	27:13	3098	37	192.972972972973	119
Vice President Joe Biden 	This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1670.63#	27:50	3135	37	162.162162162162	100

President Donald J. Trump 	So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1725.52#	28:45	3190	54	187.777777777778	169
President Donald J. Trump 	I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1779.82#	29:39	3244	56	213.214285714286	199
Chris Wallace 	All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1835#	30:35	3300	24	162.5	65
Vice President Joe Biden 	Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1859.46#	30:59	3324	39	195.384615384615	127
Vice President Joe Biden 	We’re going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1898.18#	31:38	3363	26	184.615384615385	80

Vice President Joe Biden 	The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2027.36#	33:47	3492	54	192.222222222222	173

Chris Wallace 	That’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors.

So the question is, is this really a…	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2144.73#	35:44	3609	19	167.368421052632	53
Chris Wallace 	It’s like Tulsa and Fort worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2163.701#	36:03	3628	2		16
President Donald J. Trump 	I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2165.63#	36:05	3630	40	202.5	135

Vice President Joe Biden 	I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2210.2#	36:50	3675	33	189.090909090909	104
Chris Wallace 	I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support? If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2243.09#	37:23	3708	31	133.548387096774	69
Vice President Joe Biden 	Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be…	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2274.43#	37:54	3739	41	190.243902439024	130

Chris Wallace 	And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2344.67#	39:04	3809	46	170.869565217391	131
Vice President Joe Biden 	I don’t hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted.

Vice President Joe Biden 	Here’s the point, the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2450.19#	40:50	3915	20	180	60

Chris Wallace 	I’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you’d like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2580.87#	43:00	4045	30	176	88
President Donald J. Trump 	Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2610.9#	43:30	4075	33	180	99
President Donald J. Trump 	And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military. And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2643.31#	44:03	4108	62	173.225806451613	179
President Donald J. Trump 	When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2705.34#	45:05	4170	29	175.862068965517	85

Vice President Joe Biden 	Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2742.17#	45:42	4207	32	174.375	93

Vice President Joe Biden 	So thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser.

Chris Wallace 	Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change. Mr. President, you said, I don’t think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2933#	48:53	4398	34	162.352941176471	92
President Donald J. Trump 	I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2967.55#	49:27	4432	42	184.285714285714	129

President Donald J. Trump 	I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good. We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3013.3#	50:13	4478	12	210	42
Chris Wallace 	You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3025.08#	50:25	4490	7	145.714285714286	17
President Donald J. Trump 	I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they’re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3032.5#	50:32	4497	53	185.660377358491	164
Chris Wallace 	But sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3085.26#	51:25	4550	10	192	32

Vice President Joe Biden 	Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3098.36#	51:38	4563	6	180	18
President Donald J. Trump 	Well, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3104.32#	51:44	4569	22	220.909090909091	81
Chris Wallace 	But in the case of California they have simply ignored that.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3126.38#	52:06	4591	2		11
President Donald J. Trump 	No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I’m okay with electric cars too. I think I’m all for electric cars. I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3128.09#	52:08	4593	26	216.923076923077	94
Chris Wallace 	All right, Vice president Biden. I’d like you to respond to the president’s climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3154.11#	52:34	4619	29	169.655172413793	82
Vice President Joe Biden 	He’s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future. We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do…	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3183.89#	53:03	4648	60	190	190
Vice President Joe Biden 	Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening. It’s all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, “Here’s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.”	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3243.73#	54:03	4708	68	169.411764705882	192

Vice President Joe Biden 	The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3559.95#	59:19	5024	5	180	15
Chris Wallace 	All right, gentlemen, final segment, election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3564.48#	59:24	5029	38	156.315789473684	99
Vice President Joe Biden 	Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3602.97#	60:02	5067	53	209.433962264151	185
Vice President Joe Biden 	Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that’ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s going to go. He can’t stay in power. It won’t happen. It won’t happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3655.99#	60:55	5120	57	202.105263157895	192
Chris Wallace 	Mr. President, two minutes.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3712.17#	61:52	5177	1	240	4
President Donald J. Trump 	So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them. We’ve caught them all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3713.62#	61:53	5178	42	217.142857142857	152
President Donald J. Trump 	He knew about it too. So don’t tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You’re soliciting. You’re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen. The other thing, it’s nice. On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3755.04#	62:35	5220	47	196.595744680851	154
President Donald J. Trump 	But you know what? We won’t know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame. And can you imagine where they say, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th. That’s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states [crosstalk 01:03:58] with that-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3802.51#	63:22	5267	36	203.333333333333	122

Chris Wallace 	You’re going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it’s rigged [crosstalk 00:01:04:11], that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3844.07#	64:04	5309	34	174.705882352941	99
President Donald J. Trump 	Yeah. I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don’t like them. We don’t like them. They throw them out-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3878.75#	64:38	5343	21	188.571428571429	66

President Donald J. Trump 	You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it.

Vice President Joe Biden 	Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don’t have to solicit the ballot. It’s sent to you. It’s sent to your home. What they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted.

Chris Wallace 	No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3969.77#	66:09	5434	27	175.555555555555	79
Vice President Joe Biden 	I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you. That is totally legitimate.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3996.24#	66:36	5461	33	176.363636363636	97

And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4070.52#	67:50	5535	26	163.846153846154	71
President Donald J. Trump 	I’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4096.57#	68:16	5561	28	199.285714285714	93
Chris Wallace 	You’re urging them what?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4124.89#	68:44	5589	1	240	4
President Donald J. Trump 	… I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that. And I’ll tell you why-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4125.21#	68:45	5590	8	210	28
Chris Wallace 	What does that mean, not go along-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4133.25#	68:53	5598	0		7
President Donald J. Trump 	… from a common sense-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4133.89#	68:53	5598	1		5
Chris Wallace 	Does that mean you’re going to tell your people-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4134.86#	68:54	5599	1		9

President Donald J. Trump 	It means you have a fraudulent election. You’re sending out 80 million ballots-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4136.7#	68:56	5601	4	195	13
Chris Wallace 	And what would you do about that?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4140.43#	69:00	5605	1		7
President Donald J. Trump 	They’re not equipped… These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4141.03#	69:01	5606	16	180	48

President Donald J. Trump 	You think that’s good?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4157.89#	69:17	5622	1	240	4
Chris Wallace 	Vice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4158.55#	69:18	5623	12	170	34
Vice President Joe Biden 	Yes. And here’s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military… They’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that’s what’s going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It’s the same process. It’s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4170.09#	69:30	5635	37	163.783783783784	101
President Donald J. Trump 	It’s already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4207.41#	70:07	5672	3	220	11
Chris Wallace 	I asked you. You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk 01:10:13]. Go ahead [crosstalk 01:10:14]. Vice President Biden, go ahead.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4210.74#	70:10	5675	5	240	20
Vice President Joe Biden 	He has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it. That’ll be the end of it. And if it’s me, in fact, fine. If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome. And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy-	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4215.84#	70:15	5680	26	207.692307692308	90

Chris Wallace 	… to be continued in more debates as we go on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it’s been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night. We hope you watch. Until then, thank you, and good night. Thank you.	https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q9Rg-GXXv0j4Lr42SWtShbjYi7XYyidz4UdyhtdMObqUKk7CEp-FSLuVlp1gdJztrCO_rqrjyqj0INo3riGtB9X5rpo?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=4250.35#	70:50	5715			122
